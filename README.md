How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
How do I approach designing software?

The program uploaded here contains several classes used to create services that locally store contact, task, and appointment details. Each class is tested using JUnit tests to ensure that all methods have 100% coverage prior to deployment.

To ensure software is functional and secure, it truly starts with the requirements of the client. While some security standards can be universal, it is really critical to understand the client's security needs so proper measures can be taken to ensure the safety of data and system integrations. When the requirements have been specified, testing plans can be created for ensuring the requirements have been fully met prior to release. High quality tests can be used for checking security requirements and functional requirements. They should include static testing, testing completed through visual inspection of the program, and dynamic testing, testing completed through the execution of the program. Static tests can be benefical for identifying inconsistencies, structural defects, and deviations from standards.
